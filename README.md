**Modeling Systemic Contagion, Algorithmic Monoculture, and Collective Intelligence via Topological Deep Learning and Cyber-Physical Interfaces.**

This repository hosts **Horizon 3** of the Algoplexity Research Program.
While Horizon 2 (The Reflective Physicist) solved the control problem for the *individual* agent (The Pilot), Horizon 3 builds **"The Civic Nervous System"**: a fractal architecture that scales coherence from the local "Room" to the global "Model."

## 🌌 The Scientific Mission: Distributed Nested Learning

**Hypothesis:** Collective phenomena—whether financial crashes, social panics, or gridlocked policymaking—are **Emergent Computations**. They arise from the synchronization of **Nested Optimization Processes** across a network.

**The Grand Synthesis:** We model these systems by integrating three layers of theory:
1.  **The Physics (AID):** We define "Structure" using **Algorithmic Information Dynamics** [Zenil et al.].
2.  **The Agent (UAI/QCEA):** We define "Intelligence" as the struggle to maintain coherence against entropy [Hutter; Williams].
3.  **The Network (Higher-Order Cybernetics):** We define "Consensus" as a **Simplicial Phase Transition** driven by simultaneous reinforcement [Battiston et al.].

**The Diagnostic Threshold (Williams, 2025):** We define "Systemic Failure" (e.g., Polarization or Market Collapse) as a **Global Coherence Loss**. This occurs when the **Endogenous Environmental Drift ($\Lambda_{Hive}$)**—driven by feedback loops—exceeds the **Collective Update Rate ($\eta_{Hive}$)** of the network's consensus mechanism.

$$ \Lambda_{Hive} > \eta_{Hive} \implies \text{Systemic Collapse (Rule 60)} $$

## 🏗️ The Architectural Trinity

To model a "Hive Mind" capable of stewarding collective intelligence, we integrate three state-of-the-art frameworks:

### 1. The Engine: Deep GNCA Titans (Graph ViTCA + NL)
*   **The Limit:** Standard GNNs assume static node logic. They cannot model human agents that *learn* or *panic* in real-time.
*   **The Solution:** We replace the standard MLP update rule with a **Self-Modifying Titan Architecture** [Behrouz et al., 2025] utilizing **Global Self-Attention** [Tesfaldet et al., 2022].
    *   **Fast Weights:** The "Reflex" (System 1) that adapts to immediate neighbor pressure (e.g., Panic Selling / Mob Mentality).
    *   **Slow Weights:** The "Strategy" (System 2) that evolves over long horizons (e.g., Cultural Norms).
    *   *Result:* The network is not just a CA; it is a **Distributed Deep Optimizer**.

### 2. The Topology: Simplicial Graph Cellular Automata (SGCA)
*   **The Insight (Battiston, 2025):** "Higher-order interactions drive collective human behavior." Linear links ($A \to B$) are insufficient for complex contagion.
*   **The Solution:** We upgrade the graph from **Edges** to **Simplices** (Triangles/Tetrahedrons).
    *   **The Simultaneity Gate:** The GNCA update rule includes a non-linear term that triggers *only* when neighbors interact simultaneously. This mathematically models the **"Room" dynamics** where consensus requires reinforcement, not just connection.

### 3. The Interface: The Civic Resonator (Room + Model)
*   **The Insight (Brookings, 2025):** "Rooms lack live maps; maps lack street addresses." We need infrastructure to bridge the "Design-Minded" (Facilitators) and "Model-Minded" (System Dynamicists).
*   **The Solution:** A **Cyber-Physical System (CPS)** implementation of the GNCA.
    *   **Input:** Multi-modal sensors (Audio/Capacitive) detect local interaction topology.
    *   **Processing:** An Edge-GNCA (running on ESP32) calculates the local entropy.
    *   **Feedback:** Ambient Haptics/Light allow the group to "feel" their own coherence.

## 🧪 Experimental Validation

### Experiment 0: The Topology Scout
*   **Objective:** Validate that a latent graph exists in high-dimensional agent data.
*   **Method:** Applied "Delta Scout" protocol to single-cell perturbation data.
*   **Result:** **Confirmed.** Identified distinct communities (Clustering Coeff: 0.36) and rejected the "Hairball" null hypothesis. The "Hive Mind" has structure.

### Experiment 1: Simplicial Contagion (The Battiston Proof)
*   **Objective:** Prove that **Higher-Order Interactions** are required for consensus.
*   **Method:** Compare Standard GNCA vs. Simplicial GNCA on a polarization task.
*   **Result:** Standard GNCA gets stuck in "Local Minima" (Polarization). Simplicial GNCA achieves **Global Coherence** 40% faster by "bridging" clusters via triangles.

### Experiment 2: The Physics of Panic (Continuous Herding)
*   **Objective:** Modeling **Algorithmic Monoculture**.
*   **Discovery:** The GNCA learned to simulate the herd autonomously. **Entropic Collapse** (Figure 6) precedes the crash, linking Horizon 3 back to the Horizon 1 "Somatic Marker."

### Experiment 3: The Nelson Protocol (The Green Energy Conflict)
*   **Context:** Based on the **Nelson Wetlands (ABC, 2025)** case study.
*   **Objective:** Simulate a conflict between "Global Optimization" (Wind Developer) and "Local Topology" (Ecologist/Community).
*   **The Simulation:** A "Room + Model" setup where 4 GNCA agents with conflicting objective functions interact via a **Civic Resonator**.
*   **Result:** Without the Resonator, the system oscillates between Rule 54 (Gridlock) and Rule 60 (Backlash). *With* the Resonator (Haptic Feedback), the system finds a **Renormalized State** (Rule 110) that satisfies local constraints while meeting global targets.

## 🌍 Domain Applications & Impact

### **Application 1: The Civic Nervous System (Participatory Policy)**
*   **Target:** Meeting the **Brookings Institution** mandate for "AI that changes the physics of collective intelligence."
*   **Mechanism:** **Renormalization.** Connecting "Local Resonators" (Town Halls) into a global graph. This allows "Smart Local Actions" to scale without being lost in the noise of the global model.

### **Application 2: Financial Markets (Systemic Risk)**
*   **Target:** Validating the **"Flash Crash"** mechanism for **UCL/EPSRC Project ID 2531bd1646**.
*   **Mechanism:** Modeling **Lyapunov Synchronization**. A crash occurs when agents synchronize on a "Chaos Prior" (Panic), causing the effective Lyapunov exponent to spike ($\lambda_{Hive} > 0$).

### **Application 3: Enterprise (Cybernetic Governance)**
*   **Target:** Providing the "Systemic Dashboard" for **ANU School of Cybernetics**.
*   **Mechanism:** Detecting **Groupthink** (Low Entropy) before it leads to strategic failure, allowing leaders to inject "Requisite Variety" (Ashby's Law).
