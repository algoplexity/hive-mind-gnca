**Modeling Systemic Contagion, Algorithmic Monoculture, and Collective Intelligence via Topological Deep Learning.**

This repository hosts **Horizon 3** of the Algoplexity Research Program. While Horizon 2 (The Reflective Physicist) solved the control problem for the *individual* agent, Horizon 3 simulates the *collective* dynamics of thousands of such agents interacting in a shared topology.

## 🌌 The Scientific Mission: Distributed Nested Learning

**Hypothesis:** Collective phenomena—whether financial crashes, social panics, or organizational groupthink—are **Emergent Computations**. They arise from the synchronization of **Nested Optimization Processes** across a network.

**The Theory:** We model these systems as **Deep GNCA Titans** [Behrouz et al., 2025].
*   **The Cell:** Is not a static pixel, but a **Titan**—a learning module with "Continuum Memory" (Fast & Slow weights).
*   **The Graph:** Is the medium for **Context Flow**. Agents write their state to the graph, which becomes the context for their neighbors.

**The Diagnostic Threshold (Williams, 2025):** We define a "Flash Crash" or "Systemic Failure" as a **Global Coherence Loss**. This occurs when the **Endogenous Environmental Drift ($\Lambda_{Hive}$)**—driven by feedback loops—exceeds the **Collective Update Rate ($\eta_{Hive}$)** of the network's consensus mechanism.

$$ \Lambda_{Hive} > \eta_{Hive} \implies \text{Systemic Collapse} $$

## 🏗️ The Architectural Trinity

To model a "Hive Mind" of intelligent agents, we integrate three state-of-the-art frameworks:

### 1. The Engine: Deep GNCA Titans (Graph ViTCA + NL)
*   **The Limit:** Standard GNNs assume static node logic. They cannot model agents that *learn* or *panic* in real-time.
*   **The Solution:** We replace the standard MLP update rule with a **Self-Modifying Titan Architecture** [Behrouz et al., 2025] utilizing **Global Self-Attention** [Tesfaldet et al., 2022].
    *   **Fast Weights:** The "Reflex" (System 1) that adapts to immediate neighbor pressure.
    *   **Slow Weights:** The "Strategy" (System 2) that evolves over long horizons.
    *   *Result:* The network is not just a CA; it is a **Distributed Deep Optimizer**.

### 2. The Topology: r-GCA (Relational Graph Cellular Automata)
*   **The Discovery (Scout Mission):** In our preliminary EDA on high-dimensional perturbation data (Broad Institute), we validated the **"Delta Graph" Hypothesis**. By subtracting the control centroid, we revealed a latent **"Archipelago" Topology**—distinct communities of agents sharing a mechanism of action.
*   **The Solution:** We construct the graph dynamically using **Cosine Similarity of Deltas**. This moves beyond physical adjacency (e.g., supply chains) to model **Functional Adjacency** (e.g., correlation lock-in).

### 3. The Dashboard: Differentiable Logic (DiffLogic)
*   **The Limit:** Neural Networks are opaque. A regulator cannot govern a system based on "Weights."
*   **The Solution:** We utilize **Differentiable Logic Gates [Miotti et al., 2025]**. The network learns discrete Boolean rules (AND, OR, XOR), enabling the extraction of human-readable laws: *"If Neighbor_Panic > Threshold AND Self_Liquidity < Low, THEN State = Crash."*

## 🧪 Experimental Validation

### Experiment 0: The Topology Scout
*   **Objective:** Validate that a latent graph exists in high-dimensional agent data.
*   **Method:** Applied "Delta Scout" protocol to single-cell perturbation data.
*   **Result:** **Confirmed.** Identified distinct communities (Clustering Coeff: 0.36) and rejected the "Hairball" null hypothesis. The "Hive Mind" has structure.

### Experiment 1: The Baseline (Binary Contagion)
*   **Objective:** Replicating the Voronoi experiments of **Grattarola et al. (2021)**.
*   **Financial Context:** Modeling a "Liquidity Cascade" where a bank fails if a threshold of neighbors fail.
*   **Result:** **100% Accuracy.** The GNCA learned the "Majority Vote" rule perfectly.

### Experiment 2: The Physics of Panic (Continuous Herding)
*   **Objective:** Modeling **Algorithmic Monoculture**. We treat agents as entities moving in a Strategy Space ($Position$ = Valuation, $Velocity$ = Momentum).
*   **The Discovery:** The GNCA learned to simulate the herd autonomously.

#### **Evidence: The Entropic Collapse**
![Figure 6](results/Figure_6_Hive_Mind_Entropy.png)
*   **The Meaning:** The Spatial Shannon Entropy drops steadily. This links Horizon 3 back to **Horizon 1**. **Herding causes Entropic Collapse**, which triggers the "Cognitive Saturation" signal detected by the AIT Physicist.

## 🌍 Domain Applications & Impact

### **Application 1: Financial Markets (Systemic Risk)**
*   **Target:** Validating the **"Flash Crash"** mechanism for **UCL/EPSRC Project ID 2531bd1646**.
*   **Mechanism:** Modeling **Lyapunov Synchronization**. A crash occurs when all agents switch from a "Complex Prior" (diverse rules) to a "Chaos Prior" (System 0 Panic), causing the effective Lyapunov exponent of the entire graph to spike ($\lambda_{Hive} > 0$).

### **Application 2: Society (Opinion Dynamics)**
*   **Concept:** **Information Cascades.** Modeling the propagation of "Multi-Information" (e.g., Viral Narratives) across a social graph.
*   **Mechanism:** Modeling **Network Churn**—the dynamic formation and dissolution of ties based on trust and influence.

### **Application 3: Enterprise (Cybernetic Governance)**
*   **Target:** Providing the "Systemic Dashboard" for **ANU School of Cybernetics** leadership models.
*   **Mechanism:** Detecting **Groupthink** (Low Entropy) before it leads to strategic failure, allowing leaders to inject "Requisite Variety" (Ashby's Law).
